table-diff project

TableDiff Ruby class
Copyright (c) 2008 Kentfield School District.

This class encapsulates the DBI connections to two tables whose
contents are to be compared.  For each connection, you must specify
a table name, the columns within the table that will be compared,
and the columns that will be used as a primary key to identify
the same records within each table.

Code for this class is a Ruby/DBI port of the pg_comparator perl 
command-line program written for Postgresql by Fabian Coelho.  
See http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pg-comparator for the latest
version of the perl source on which this port was based.

Tested with dbd-mysql and a few different tables.  I would love to see
if the CRC / XOR / CONCAT / CREATE TABLE AS SELECT code would work with 
Sqlite3 or another SQL dialect. Feel free to fork or send patches to
